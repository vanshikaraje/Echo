We are only given the index.html content. We don't have the actual JavaScript (script.js) implementation, so we have to simulate the behavior by mocking the voice recognition and the response generation.

However, note that the test must run in a JSDOM environment (which Jest provides) and we cannot test the actual voice recognition because that is a Web API. Therefore, we will mock the SpeechRecognition API and the functions in script.js.

Steps for the test file:

1. Set up the JSDOM environment with the provided HTML.
2. Mock the SpeechRecognition API and any other necessary browser APIs.
3. Mock the functions in script.js? But note: we don't have the script.js. So we have to assume the structure.

Alternatively, we can write tests that simulate the events and check the DOM changes. However, without the implementation, we have to rely on the expected behavior.

But note: The user only asked for test cases. We are to write a Jest test file.

We'll write tests that:
- Check the initial state.
- Simulate a button click and check that the button text changes and the voice image becomes visible (if that's the behavior).
- Simulate a successful voice recognition event and check that the chat container updates.
- Simulate an error event and check the error message.

However, without the actual code, we have to mock the SpeechRecognition and the response generation.

Let's assume that the script.js uses the Web Speech API. We can mock it.

We'll create a test file that:

1. Sets up the DOM from the index.html string.
2. Mocks the SpeechRecognition class and its methods.
3. Requires the script.js? But we don't have it. So we cannot actually run the script.

Alternatively, we can write tests that are independent of the script.js implementation by spying on the button click and then dispatching the events that the script would have dispatched? But that might be too low level.

Given the constraints, we can only write tests that are based on the expected behavior and by simulating the events that the script.js would trigger.

But note: The test must be runnable. So we have to include the script.js? We don't have it. So we cannot run the actual code.

Therefore, we have two options:
1. Write unit tests for the DOM manipulation and event handlers by mocking the SpeechRecognition and the response logic. This requires us to know the structure of the script.js, which we don't.

2. Write a set of tests that are based on the user's description and the HTML, and then simulate the events and check the DOM. But without the script, we have to simulate the entire flow by manually triggering the event handlers that would be set by script.js.

Given the ambiguity, I will write tests that assume the following:

- The script.js sets up an event listener on the button with id "btn" for the 'click' event.
- When the button is clicked, it starts the speech recognition and changes the button text and shows the voice animation.
- The speech recognition is implemented using the Web Speech API (window.SpeechRecognition).

We will mock the SpeechRecognition API and then simulate the events.

We'll create a test file named: `script.test.js`

Plan:

1. Set up the DOM before each test.
2. Mock the SpeechRecognition API and set it on the window.
3. Load the script.js? But we don't have it. So we cannot. Instead, we will write tests that are independent of the actual script? That's not possible.

Alternatively, we can write the tests as if we are testing the behavior of the page, and we will simulate the events that the script would fire. But without the script, we have to write the event handlers in the test? That's not ideal.

Given the challenge, I will write the tests by including a mock implementation of the expected script.js behavior in the test setup. But note: the user might run the test with the actual script.js? We don't have it.

Alternatively, we can write the tests in a way that they will pass if the script.js is implemented as expected. We can mock the SpeechRecognition and then simulate the events that the script would listen for.

Let me propose:

We'll create a mock for the SpeechRecognition:

```javascript
class SpeechRecognitionMock {
  constructor() {
    this.start = jest.fn();
    this.stop = jest.fn();
    this.onresult = null;
    this.onerror = null;
    this.onend = null;
  }
}
window.SpeechRecognition = SpeechRecognitionMock;
```

Then, we can simulate a recognition result by calling the `onresult` handler with a mock event.

But without the actual script, we have to assume that the script.js is structured to use this API.

We'll write the tests as follows:

1. Test initial state.
2. Test button click: it should create a SpeechRecognition instance and call start.
3. Test that when recognition returns a result, the button text is reset and the chat container is updated.

But note: we don't have the script, so we cannot run it. Therefore, we must simulate the entire behavior of the script in the test? That would be testing the mock, not the real code.

Given the constraints, I will write a test that sets up the DOM and then includes a minimal mock implementation of the script.js for testing purposes. This is not ideal, but it allows us to write meaningful tests.

Alternatively, we can skip including the script and just test the DOM. But then we cannot test the button click because there is no event handler.

Therefore, I will write a test that:

- Sets up the DOM.
- Defines a minimal implementation of the expected script in the test (as a mock) so that we can simulate the behavior.

But note: the test file should be independent. We are not allowed to change the script.js? We are only allowed to write tests.

Given the ambiguity, I will write the tests by including a mock for the SpeechRecognition and then simulate the events that the script would have attached. We'll attach the event handlers in the test to mimic the script.

This is a workaround.

Let's write the test file:

```javascript
// script.test.js

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Read the HTML file and set up the DOM
const html = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, './index.html'), 'utf8');

document.body.innerHTML = html;

// Mock the SpeechRecognition
class SpeechRecognitionMock {
  constructor() {
    this.start = jest.fn();
    this.stop = jest.fn();
    this.continuous = false;
    this.interimResults = false;
    this.lang = '';
    this.onresult = null;
    this.onerror = null;
    this.onend = null;
  }
}

window.SpeechRecognition = SpeechRecognitionMock;

// Now, we need to require the script.js? But we don't have it. So we cannot.

// Instead, we'll write a mock event handler for the button that uses our mock SpeechRecognition.
// This is a substitute for the actual script.js.

// We are going to
